# Architecture Decisions — Aether Core

## ADR-001: Spring Boot 3.3.x + Java 21
**Decision:** Use the same technology stack as Aether Grid.
**Rationale:** Ecosystem consistency, shared Java 21 features (records, sealed classes, virtual threads), same developer mental model across both repos. Grid and Core can share deployment tooling.

## ADR-002: Port 8082
**Decision:** Core API runs on port 8082.
**Rationale:** Grid proxy=8080, Grid api=8081, Core=8082. Clean port allocation within the ecosystem for local development without conflicts.

## ADR-003: Separate PostgreSQL database (`aether_core`)
**Decision:** Core uses its own `aether_core` database, not Grid's database.
**Rationale:** Data isolation — personal user memories must not be co-located with enterprise API governance data. Enables independent backup, retention, and GDPR policies per layer.

## ADR-004: REST over gRPC for Grid integration
**Decision:** `GET /api/v1/personal-context/{tenantId}/{userId}` over HTTP/1.1 REST.
**Rationale:** Simpler initial integration. Grid's `RestClient` adapter works without proto generation. HTTP/2 upgrade is optional later. gRPC can replace REST in Phase 4+ if latency becomes a concern.

## ADR-005: 384-dim embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
**Decision:** Same embedding model and dimension as Aether Grid.
**Rationale:** If Grid and Core ever share a vector similarity search (e.g., cross-referencing personal memory against enterprise API patterns), vector dimensions must match. Consistent model = comparable similarity scores.

## ADR-006: Memory reinforcement on read
**Decision:** `PersonalMemory.reinforce()` is called each time a memory is retrieved. `strength += 0.1`, capped at 1.0. Access count incremented.
**Rationale:** Mirrors human memory — frequently accessed memories strengthen. Rarely accessed memories weaken (decay scheduled for Phase 5).

## ADR-007: Independent Maven project (not child of Grid's pom.xml)
**Decision:** `aether-core/pom.xml` is a standalone parent POM, not a module of `aether-grid/pom.xml`.
**Rationale:** Enables extraction to `suplab/aether-core` without any Maven refactoring. Each project builds and deploys independently.
